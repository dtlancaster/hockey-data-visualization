<b>hockey_data.py</b>

With the current project structure, the collected data is already stored within the three .csv files.<br/>
If you wish to see the web scraper in action, simply delete the three .csv files and open `hockey_data.py`
in a Python IDE of your choosing (PyCharm, Spyder, VSCode, etc).

Alternatively, if you wish to run this program through the console, make sure you have Python installed and navigate to the project directory.</br>
You can run the code by doing the following:

`python hockey_data.py`

You should then see the three .csv files appear in your project directory with their respective data.</br>
It is recommended to run the web scraper if one day has passed since you last did it, as with the 2020-2021 season being the current season, the data changes <b>daily</b>.

<b>hockey_graphs.py</b>

This python file utilizes the .csv files generated from the previous file and creates visuals based on suspected correlations among the data.</br>

If using an IDE, run the file, and then navigate to the 'Plots' pane in order to see the created visuals.</br>

Alternatively, if you wish to run this program through the console, make sure you have Python installed and navigate to the project directory.</br>
You can run the code by doing the following:

`python hockey_graphs.py`
